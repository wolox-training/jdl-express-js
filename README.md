# ExpressJS Bootstrap [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Wolox/express-js-bootstrap.png)](https://travis-ci.org/wolox-training/jdl-express-js.svg?branch=master)

Kickoff for [graphql](graphql.org) applications.

## First steps

#### Getting dependencies
Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn``` from rootpath of the project.

#### Starting your app
Now, to start your app run ```npm start``` in the rootpath of the project. Then access your app at **localhost:port**. The port is logged in the console where you ran the start script.

## Development

#### Environments
By default, the environment will be **development**, but you can easily change it using the **NODE_ENV** environmental variable.

#### Environment variables
`Dotenv` is used for managing environment variables. They are stored in the `/.env` file. Take into account that the variables defined in the `bashrc` are not overrided.

The environment variables should be added to the `.env` file in the form of `NAME=VALUE`.

**Remember not to push nor commit the `.env` file.**


#### Debugging
As we know, a NodeJS application is not something easy to debug and because of that we've added the `--inspect` flag to make it simpler. Chrome DevTools will get started when running your app using the start script (`npm start`), making your debugging easier.

#### REPL console
We can use a node console with `npm run console`. There your service objects are exposed as _servicename_ + "Service". Let's suppose that we have a service `users` which has a function `getAll`. In your console you can call `usersService.getAll()` and see the result. Note that this works also with functions that return promises! To exit the console use `.exit`.

#### Documentation
Documentation will be served at `/docs`. Remember using [dictum.js](http://www.github.com/Wolox/dictum.js) package to automatically generate documentation for your endpoints. Check [this link](https://github.com/Wolox/dictum.js#chai) for further details.
